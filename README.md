# CryptoHelperCSC4349

We will be working on a Java project called Cryptohelper. The application allows the user to encrypt and decrypt strings based on the selected cipher. Basically, a string is being changed based on the selected algorithm in order to mask the actual message.It is a simple concept, but some of the ciphers can get very math heavy. This program simplifies everything for the user, removing the element of human error if it were to be done by hand.

Our main focus will be adding new features to the existing project. These features for the most part will be different ciphers(found in the TODO file), though we also plan to implement I/O from separate files. If we end up with extra time, the GUI will be updated as well. As the source code is currently one file with over 3000 lines and little modularity, we will also refactor it.
